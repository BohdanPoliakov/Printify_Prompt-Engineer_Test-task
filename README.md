# Printify_Prompt-Engineer_Test-task

Hi, this is Bohdan and in my README file I want to describe how my code works. 

## Task Completion Overview

I have completed the task that was sent to me in the AI.py file. It was not very complicated and it took me about an hour to complete it, I really hope I did it right and everything is as you expected.  In the generate_store_banner function I used the openai key I created for myself and set a parameter for the bot, then in the store_name variable I wrote the name of my shop and in the store_description variable I passed a brief description of my shop. I also wrote in the comments that this variable can be changed so that the name and description of the store would be set in the input, but since the console should output only the phrase, I decided to leave the variables with the written name. And after running the code, the programme perfectly outputs to the console the text we need, which can perfectly fit into the banner for our shop.

## Advanced Development with Flask

As I mentioned, I was able to solve the task quite quickly, I decided to complicate it a bit with the help of Flask for my own development by creating an endpoint in which the phrase is generated. If we run the code, in the terminal we will see the host running, copying it we can paste it into the browser and add the name of our function `/generate_banner` to the endpoint and we will successfully see the generated phrase for our shop.

Thank you for reading my README file. I really hope that the task I have completed is correct, as I am excited to develop and improve my skills at Printify.
